# Frontend Mentor - multipage-form solution

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
- I learnt how to call data from previous pages to a new page using JSON
- I also learnt how to create toggle buttons using css.
- I tried to use the setTimeout method to erase the form validation message after few seconds.
